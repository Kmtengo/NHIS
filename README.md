# About the project
The **National Helath Iintegrated System** aims to create a harmonized _healthcare management system_ that can be used by all public hospitals across the country and even beyond. The system will bring together critical patient information, such as **medical history**, **lab results** and **prescribed medications** and make it accessible to authorized healthcare providers in _real-time_.

## Technologies
The National Health Integrated System is a Web Project which combines web technologies i.e. **HTML**, **CSS** and **Javascript** with Azure cloud technologies like **Azure App Services**, **Azure SQL Database** and **OpenAI chat models** to bring an end to the _fragmented_ and _disjointed_ healthcare system that currently exists in our country.

## Goal
* The current system is inefficient, with a lack of information sharing between healthcare facilities leading to _duplicated efforts_, _increased costs_, and _potential health risks for patients_.
* The goal of this project is to create a **centralized** and **integrated** healthcare management system that can be used by all hospitals across the country.
* The system will bring together critical patient information such as medical history, lab results and prescribed medications, and make it accessible to authorized healthcare providers in real-time. This will _eliminate the need for paper records_ and ensure that medical professionals have access to complete and up-to-date information, regardless of where a patient has received treatment in the past.
